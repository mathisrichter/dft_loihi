General questions
----------------
- how do DFT concepts translate to spiking dynamics?
  * attractor
  * repellor
  * bistability
  * instability

- parameter constraints for dynamic regimes
  * number of neurons
  * resting level
  * spiking threshold
  * synaptic strength (this and above are all interdependent)
  * time scales
  * spike rates!

- synchronization of firing
  * within recurrent population
  * across populations connected along a chain

- (refactoring the code)
  * creating plotting functions
  * centralized standard parameters that may be overwritten


0D
----------------
- detection, reverse detection, hysteresis                  WORKING
